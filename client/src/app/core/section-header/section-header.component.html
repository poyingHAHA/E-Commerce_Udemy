<!-- the async pipe in Angular is going to subscribe automatically to this particular observable.
    And crucially, when our component is destroyed, it's automatically going to unsubscribe from this observable as well.
    What we can also do inside here after the parentheses, we can say as breadcrumbs.
    And we can use this property now inside the rest of our template. -->
